## Suggestions before starting
 * It is advisable to view videos at 1.25x or 1.5x as most of them are usually slow
 * If you find any difficulty during learning, just start an issue in the issue section of this github repository.
 * I tried my best and used my own experience in compiling materials,  you can use any other sources which makes you feel comfortable.
 * lastly i will suggest some blogging sites and search engines which helps you most of the time.

</p>

In deep learning, we will focus on Multi Layer Perceptron (Neural Networks), moving on from Logistic Regression.


#### Bare Essentials

[Neural networks and deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) by Andrew NG. Do this, assuming you have completed the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course by Andrew NG. If you haven't please go through that course first and make sure complete week 5 in it.

[Neural Networks: Playground Exercises by Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/introduction-to-neural-networks/playground-exercises)(Do see it once. Not absolutely essential, but very helpful for visualizing and building simple neural networks on the go and seeing the results)

**Libraries**
Due to the advancement in deep learnig, there are different types of programming frameworks available like
 * Tensorlow(older version 1.1)
 * keras(with tensorlow as backend lastest tensorflow 2.0)
 * Torch
 * Theano
 * Pytorch and many more...
 
 Every framework will be suitable for different types of works, for our purposes keras with tensorflow and torch are the best 
 
 So we use here keras due to easier code implementation
 
 [Video Series on working with Keras (Both installation and Code practice in keras)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xrwRnXk_yCPtnqqo4_u2YGL)(Intermediate level). You can leave the backend selected as Tensorflow. The videos on deployment and Tensorflow.js are not required to be seen. Don't worry about CNNs as it comes later.

**Use all the knowledge of neural nets and work on the same dataset given for logistic regression and compare the results of both**

-----------------------

### CNN (Convolutional Neural Neetworks)

<p align="center">
 <img  width="600" height="400" src="https://spatial-lang.readthedocs.io/en/legacy/_images/conv2d.gif">
</p>

Before starting CNN it is important that you have completed these things:

1) Neural networks and deep learning by Andrew NG.

2) Machine Learning course by Andrew NG till week 5(optional if the above course is done). 

After completing them you will understand  the working of neural networks(forward and backward propagation) and why they are so powerful.

**Now we are ready to dive into basics of CNN. Follow this link.**

[Convolutional Neural Networks | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)

The first 10 lectures of this course will give you a basic idea of working and the later are concentrated on some application part: Object detection, Face recognition and Neural Style Transfer.

# Implementation

### Hello World

Basic implementation of CNNs and neural networks:

The [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.You can found the MNIST practice comp held at kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).
**For any help look at the kernels available on kaggle**

### Finally Sequence Models and NLP(natural language processing)


![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7e64d65a-4a87-4a81-a6b1-a320098dd734/NLP-image.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7e64d65a-4a87-4a81-a6b1-a320098dd734/NLP-image.jpg)

we focus on Sequence modelling and application in the field of Natural Language Processing(NLP)

#### Prerequisites

To properly understand the material for this week, the following material should be well understood or the material covered in the courses:-

→ Convolutional Neural Networks by Andrew Ng on Coursera

→ Scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib

#### Let's get started

You all have seen how a convolutional network works and how to use image data and train a model to classify images. While dealing with image data, there was no question on how to represent an image for training the model because it was already given in pixel form i.e. you don't need to work on how to represent the images. But this is not the case with text data.

Text data in its raw form is just a string which makes no sense to the computer or a model cannot be trained on it until it has been converted into numerical vectors. There are various processes how it is done, which are described in the medium article.

The above article describes the basic practices in text processing and some basic NLP tasks. 

Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization etc. are few of the techniques to process data before training the ML model on it. 

There is a python text processing module known as NLTK(Natural Language ToolKit) for performing the text processing tasks as described in the article above. The working examples and the tutorial of the module are given in detail in the article described below.

[NLTK for Beginners -NLP](https://medium.com/@pemagrg/nlp-for-beginners-using-nltk-f58ec22005cd)

The documentation for the NLTK can be accessed [here](https://www.nltk.org/) and the book based on the documentation can be assessed [here](https://www.nltk.org/book/).

For modelling the data into prediction various types of classical methodologies were developed. 

One of them is bag-of-words described in the article below.

[](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/fundamentals-of-bag-of-words-and-tf-idf-9846d301ff22)

#### Here comes Deep Learning

Like any other machine learning task, NLP tasks such as POS tagging, NER classification etc. also gives state-of-the-result with deep learning techniques.

The following course discusses most the techniques and types of deep learning architectures used in NLP.

[Sequence Models | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)

It is advisable to view all the video provided in the course in addition to the quizzes. However, the assignment part of the course is optional. The course discusses the basic techniques without going into very deep technical details of the methods.

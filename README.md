#### Libraries
Python library is a collection of functions and methods that allows you to perform many actions without writing your code. Each library in Python contains a huge number of useful modules that you can import for your every day programming.
   * Below are some libraries used in loading and processing data
     * **Numpy**
        - [Installation](https://numpy.org/install/)
        - [Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-numpy/)
     * **Pandas**
       - [Exhaustive tutorial to master pandas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS)
       - [Pandas functions cheat sheet](https://towardsdatascience.com/my-python-pandas-cheat-sheet-746b11e44368)
     * **matplotlib and Seaborn**
       - **Insallation for Matplotlib**- Type (conda install matplotlib) in command prompt
       - **Insallation for seaborn**- Type (conda install seaborn) in command prompt 
       - [Data Visualisation using Matplotlib and seaborn](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-visualization-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-a45178970be7#:~:text=The%20heatmap%20from%20seaborn%20library,with%20an%20optional%20color%20bar.&text=In%20Machine%20learning%20applications%2C%20it,between%202%20different%20hyperparameters%20etc.)

**There are many other libraries used in Machine learning, details regarding those will be given along with subsequent uses later.**
 

  

### Materials

</p>

**According to Wikipedia**- Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. ... It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines. if you want to know more about what AI and Ml, follow this [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-do-you-know-about-artificial-intelligence-cd91cd3946dd)

## Machine learning

<p align="center">
 <img  width="400" height="400" src="https://github.com/Amanmishra267/ML-work/blob/master/ml.png"><br>
</p>

 machine learning is the subfield of AI that helps the computers to realize a task without being explicitly programmed.
 
 A more detailed introduction about ML and its types is given [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-an-introduction-23b84d51e6d0), and if you are intrested in videos see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj0neYUp9Tc)

**According to Wikipedia**- Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. ... It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines. if you want to know more about what AI and Ml, follow this [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-do-you-know-about-artificial-intelligence-cd91cd3946dd)

## Machine learning
 machine learning is the subfield of AI that helps the computers to realize a task without being explicitly programmed.
 
 A more detailed introduction about ML and its types is given [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-an-introduction-23b84d51e6d0), and if you are intrested in videos see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj0neYUp9Tc)
